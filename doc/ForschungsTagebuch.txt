- include error term in latent state process: \epsilon_{it} i.e. similar to
	adding random effects over time

- resolve contemporaneous error term dependence with correct regressor 			specification in latent state process

%%%%% Code:
- add branch: master
- add branch: "MLE with Gauss hermite" --> MLE_GH
- add branch: "HMC" --> HMC
- @branch master:
	- import data generating process code
	- clean  data generating process code
- @branch MLE_GH: 
	- 4 R-packages: find best
		- check computing time (C++ implement vs. rest)
		- check accuracy
- @branch HMC: 
	- port Code
	- clean-up
	- make faster
	- investigate blocking
