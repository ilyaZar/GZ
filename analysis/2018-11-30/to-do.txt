elaborating on to-dos form three commits before (commit ID: cd76b14a44....)

things that have been done:

things to-do update:

I. minor fixes to PGAS
- find sample.int-bug: some states are proposed that lead to NA weights: set the log-weights to -Inf
- correct update rates: the first state is still always update 100% since the first weights are set to 1/N....
- run with enlarged number of particles and more iterations: see if there are changes to the update rates

II. add documentation pipeline
- make a proper Rmarkdown document which is able to incorporate the results with all figs in doc/fig/....
- make proper tables in LaTeX for the Rmarkdown document
- make a comparison between ideal Gibbs run and PGAS to see difference in estimation quality, in particular test for the remaining pairwise states to be sampled correctly and then try 3 states; experiment with different number of particles and mcmc run-lengths -> put the result into an Rmarkdown doc
- make a test with a constant for ideal Gibbs and PGAS to see difference in estimation quality and put the result into an Rmarkdown doc (seperate folder from 2018-11-30)
